# LoLTrackers

LoLTrackers is an innovative all-in-one standalone app in development for League of Legends enthusiasts. It aims to retrieve, analyze, and display data such as current performance, record of unconventional attributes like movement speed, damage, and stacks, as well as other information that OTPs and mains would love to see, all in a fun and casual manner.

The initial goal of this application is to function as an overlay for streams, with masking (green screen, etc.), displaying all this information in real-time. It will feature playful messages showcasing players' achievements. Similar to, but not imitating and innovating greatly on, League of Legends' Eternals system.

Please note that this is still an early-stage project and a functional preview is not yet available.
